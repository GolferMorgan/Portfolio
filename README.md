# Portfolio
Thank you for your time! This is a working prototype of my work portfolio.

## The Process
This was a more dificult task due to the fact that the entire thing was built from scratch. It was a great learning process. I was able to figure out when to use class vs id and also when code became repetitive and I was able to merge that code and make it run more seemless. I have attached links to my two completed projects and also a future link to where I hope to be. I have also added my email and GitHub so that I can be contacted but I left room to add more such as a linkedin profile.

## Deployment
The portfolio is deployed and a functioning website. All links currently work and direct you to the appropriate area.
